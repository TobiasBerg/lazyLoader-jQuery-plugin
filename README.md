Lazyloader is designed to excecute custom javascript on a bunch of elements once they get into view of the user.

This can be used for lazyloading pictures but in my case I'm using it for loading groups of products in a webshop.

The goal of this plugin is providing a one stop for all you lazy loading needs.

This is my first jQuery plugin. Since I'm still learning there might be some pretty bad mistakes. Please help me fix them so we can make this better.
