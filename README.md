# LazyLoader jQuery plugin

Traditional lazyloaders are created to load one element at a time.
With this lazyloader I'm trying to solve the problem of having to load a group of elements as seen in for example web shops.

This Lazyloader is designed to excecute custom javascript on one or more elements once they get into view of the user.

See examples on usage.
